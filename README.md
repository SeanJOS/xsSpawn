# xsSpawn
Ground Spawn or Halo Selection with Base Spawning for Exile

What is it?
It is a custom spawn selection screen that replaces the default exile spawn selection and it gives you the option to either halo spawn or ground spawn. You can also spawn at your base with some customizable options.

You can also add your server logo and custom messeages to be displayed when your players spawn, like important announcments or server tips.

I take no credt for these at all. I simply merged these two awesome scripts together to get the best of both worlds.
